## Overview and Origin
Founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, an ex-Goldman Sachs trader, Coinbase has established itself as a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform (Wikipedia, 2023). The inception of the company was supported by Y Combinator, a startup incubator program, which initially injected $150,000 into the venture (Wikipedia, 2023).

Throughout its existence, Coinbase has successfully navigated numerous funding rounds, amassing a total of $678.7 million across 19 distinct rounds (Crunchbase, 2023). Its most recent round of funding was a post-IPO debt round that took place on September 5, 2023 (Crunchbase, 2023). The company's financial backing comes from a diverse pool of 78 investors, notable among them being ARK Investment Management and ADM VENTURES (Crunchbase, 2023).

Coinbase reached a significant funding milestone in January 2015, securing an investment of $75 million from a group of investors including Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA, and several banks. In the same month, the company expanded its offerings by launching Coinbase Exchange, a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange tailored for professional traders (Wikipedia, 2023).

3. **Quick Withdrawals:** Coinbase enables immediate withdrawal of cryptocurrencies after purchase with fiat currency, benefiting users who want to use cryptocurrency in decentralized apps and other services ([NerdWallet, 2023]).

4. **Blockchain Infrastructure:** Coinbaseâ€™s infrastructure focuses on security, scalability, and stability. It is "blockchain agnostic," allowing easy integration of new blockchain technologies. Key aspects include immutability, ephemerality, consensus, and automation ([AWS Startups Blog, n.d.]).

5. **Snapchain and Network Load Balancers:** Coinbase uses Snap chain for deploying blockchain nodes and Network Load Balancers (NLBs) to manage snapshots and ensure reliable node operation, minimizing network sync time and enabling rapid redeployment of blockchain states ([AWS Startups Blog, n.d.]).

These technological innovations and strategic approaches position Coinbase as a comprehensive and user-friendly platform in the cryptocurrency market.

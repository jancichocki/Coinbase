## Overview and Origin
Coinbase, a renowned cryptocurrency exchange service, was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. Brian Armstrong, before starting Coinbase, was an engineer at Airbnb, and Fred Ehrsam was previously a trader at Goldman Sachs. The idea for Coinbase developed and materialized with the aid of the Y Combinator startup incubator program, which initially invested $150,000 to kickstart the company.

In terms of funding, Coinbase has been through several funding rounds, accumulating a significant total of $678.7 million across 19 rounds. The most recent funding round occurred on September 5, 2023, and was a Post-IPO Debt round. Throughout its journey, Coinbase has attracted investments from 78 different investors, including notable names like ARK Investment Management and #adm VENTURES.

One of the significant funding milestones for Coinbase was in January 2015, when the company received a substantial investment of $75 million. This round of funding was led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA, and several banks. In the same month, Coinbase launched a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange specifically designed for professional traders, named Coinbase Exchange.
